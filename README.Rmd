# mispur
Mispur is an R package designed to implement the moment inequality econometric model outlined in "Mispecified Moment Inequality Models: Inference and Diagnostics" (Andrews and Kwon 2022.)
In it's current form, the package focuses on cases where the moment function is "additively separable" i.e. the case where we have the following functional form:
m(W,theta) = g(W) + f(theta) 

## Installation

You can install the development version of mispur from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("patrick-rhatigan/mispur")
```
